        "answer": "The text discusses the risk of subsequent primary neoplasms (cancers) among survivors of adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer. The study found that the risk of developing new cancers increases with time since diagnosis, particularly for those who had survived at least 5 years from diagnosis.\n\nSpecifically, the researchers identified a small number of specific subsequent primary neoplasms that account for a high proportion of the total excess number of neoplasms. Notably, lung cancer was found to be the most common cause of excess neoplasms across all AYA groups investigated.\n\nThe study also found that subsequent primary neoplasms can occur in potentially irradiated sites, such as the chest and pelvis, which may be related to radiation therapy received during initial cancer treatment. The findings provide an evidence base for clinical follow-up specifically relating to the AYA population.\n\nOverall, the study highlights the importance of long-term follow-up and monitoring for survivors of AYA cancer, particularly those who have received radiation therapy, as they are at increased risk of developing new cancers over time."

            "answer": "Here are some key points from the text:\n\n**Main finding**: The risk of subsequent primary neoplasms increases with increased period of follow-up from diagnosis after each AYA (adolescent and young adult) cancer investigated.\n\n**Specific findings**:\n\n* For patients who had survived at least 5 years from diagnosis of cervical cancer, testicular cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, and breast cancer, a small number of specific subsequent primary neoplasms accounted for high proportions of the total excess number of neoplasms.\n* The excess number of neoplasms was notable for lung cancer across all AYA groups investigated.\n\n**Notable points**:\n\n* Subsequent primary neoplasms occurred in potentially irradiated sites, such as lung and breast tissue.\n* The study provides an evidence base for clinical follow-up relating specifically to the AYA population.\n\n**Methodology**: The study was funded by Cancer Research UK and involved a literature search, data analysis, and interpretation of data. The authors declare no competing interests.\n\n**References**: The text includes numerous references to previous studies on this topic, including articles from peer-reviewed journals such as Lancet Oncology, Acta Oncologica, and Cancer."

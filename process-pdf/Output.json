        "summary": "The risk of developing excess subsequent primary neoplasms increases with the length of follow-up after diagnosis for various types of cancer in adolescents and young adults (AYA). In patients who survived at least 5 years from diagnosis, a small number of specific subsequent primary neoplasms were identified, accounting for a high proportion of the total excess number of neoplasms. Lung cancer was found to be a significant contributor to this excess risk across all AYA groups investigated.",

        "summary": "Here is a summary of the text:\n\nThe articles reviewed discuss the role of lysyl oxidase (LO) in megakaryocyte expansion, bone marrow fibrosis, and myeloproliferative neoplasms. LO inhibition has been shown to attenuate hallmarks of primary myelofibrosis in mice. Additionally, combining LO inhibitors with azacytidine can restore erythropoiesis in myelodysplastic and myeloid malignancies. Targeting fibrotic mechanisms and clinical trials are also discussed. The expression of LO gene family members is upregulated in myeloproliferative neoplasms, and adhesion to collagen is enhanced in primary myelofibrosis.",
